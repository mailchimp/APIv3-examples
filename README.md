# Deprecated - Mailchimp API v3.0 Examples

## Deprecation Notice
We recommend checking out our [Guides](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/) for help and code samples.
Check out the [Mailchimp SDK CodeGen repo](https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-client-lib-codegen) to engage with our open source community.

## Description

Within this repository, you'll find straight-forward examples of working with v3 the MailChimp API without any
wrapper libraries. The goal is to get you up and writing code as quickly as possible. Each language has its own 
folder, and each of those folders will have a README.md file describing what the requirements are for the examples.

## General Instructions

Each of the examples will expect to find an API key in a file called 'APIKEY' here in the root folder. 

## Contributions

We welcome pull requests to these examples to fix bugs or demonstrate new behavior, so long as the code is easy to understand!

## Requests?

If there's a certain kind of problem you'd like to see an example of or a language you'd like to 
see supported, please open a GitHub issue. Note, we can't promise that we'll be able to address all requests.
